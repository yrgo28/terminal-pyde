#PYDE, a minimal way to manage your python projects.

STEPS:

1.Put your python project directory (/path/to/your/project)
2.Type "E" to open that directory and edit files.
3.Enjoy!

OBJETIVE: Make a conformable way to manage python projects using vim and jedi-vim. 

FUN FACT: I have this idea because i'm in a chromebook (have just 16GB disk space, and 8GB left after so installation). I never find a really minimal way for edit my python's projects, and i just made this :)

INSTALATION/DEPENDECES (Install it from software distributors and pip):
1. vim
2. jedi-vim (this is in another repo, but in arch linux can install it just typing "pacman -S vim-jedi") #KISS
3. python3
4. termcolor (from pip "pip install termcolor")
5. (optional) add an alias like ("alias pyde='python3 ~/pyde/pyde.py'")

FIRST TIME USING:
* PYDE have not "autosave" (yet), so you need to modify "pyderc.py" for save your preferences
* If you want to change working directory in a session, just type "W" in options menu, specify your directory and nothing else!

Sorry for my bad english, i'm from venezuela and i also learning this language lol. I hope you like this little project :)
